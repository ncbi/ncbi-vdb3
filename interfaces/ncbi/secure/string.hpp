     * The world's default "character set" (encoding) has been UNICODE

     * a multi-byte representation. This string class treats characters
     * in two ways: as UTF-8 within the sequence and as UTF-32 when
     * referring to individual characters.
     *
     * The treatment of wnords as basic natural language elements has also
     * been commonplace for decades, with support for immutable strings
     * in languages such as Java.
     *
     * This String is semantically defined to contain zero or more
     * UNICODE characters. It cannot be used to contain any other type
     * of data. There is NO assumption that the internal sequence is
     * NUL-terminated.
